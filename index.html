      <h2 id="chart-title">In 2023, women only earned 81¢ per dollar</h2>

    <div id="chart-text">
      <p>Historically, <b>women have earned less than men in nearly every field</b>, but the <b>size of the gap has shifted over time for each field</b> — and <b>it isn’t the same everywhere.</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>In this report, <b>we examine the gender pay gap across a range of occupations over the past decade</b>.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Do women enter into lower-paying occupations?</h2>
    <div id="occupation-text">
      <p><b>Could the gender wage gap be due to women entering lower-paying fields?</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>To examine that, we looked at the <b>proportion of male and female workers in each occupation, sorted by median pay</b> — highlighting which fields lean heavily male, which lean heavily female, and which remain balanced.</p>
      <br>

    <div id="occupation-text-2">
      <p>It’s clear that some occupations are strongly gendered.<br>
         Fields like Healthcare Support and Healthcare Practitioners are predominantly held by women,<br>
         while Construction and Maintenance remain overwhelmingly male‑dominated.<br>
         Other categories, such as Legal and Business & Finance, hovered just above 50% female, challenging some of our assumptions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>This observation led us to consider: <b>does the percentage of women in an occupation relate to how large or small the gender pay gap is within that field?</b> Are female‑dominated industries more equitable when it comes to compensation—or does the gap persist regardless of gender representation? How has that gap changed in the past decade?</p>
