      <h2 id="chart-title">In 2023, women only earned 81¢ per dollar</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="chart-text">
      <p>Historically, <b>women have earned less than men in nearly every field</b>, but the <b>size of the gap has shifted over time for each field</b> — and <b>it isn’t the same everywhere.</b></p>
      <br>   
      <p>In this report, <b>we examine the gender pay gap across a range of occupations over the past decade</b>.</p>

    <div id="occupation-text">
      <p><b>Could the gender wage gap be due to women entering lower-paying fields?</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>To examine that, we looked at the <b>proportion of male and female workers in each occupation, sorted by median pay</b> — highlighting which fields lean heavily male, which lean heavily female, and which remain balanced.</p>

    <div id="occupation-text-2">
        <p>It’s clear that some occupations are strongly gendered.<br> 
            Fields like Healthcare Support and Healthcare Practitioners are predominantly held by women, 
            while Construction and Maintenance remain overwhelmingly male‑dominated.<br>
            Other categories, such as Legal and Business & Finance, stood out as they hovered just 
            above 50% female, which challenged some of our individual assumptions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This observation led us to consider: <b>does the percentage of women in an occupation 
            relate to how large or small the gender pay gap is within that field? Are female‑dominated 
            industries more equitable when it comes to compensation—or does the gap persist regardless 
            of gender representation? How has that gap changed in the past decade?</b></p>
