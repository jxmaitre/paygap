    <h1>Exploring the Gender Pay Gap</h1>

      <h2 id="chart-title">In 2023, women earned just 84¢ for every dollar that men earned</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="chart-text">
      <p>Historically, <b>women have earned less than men in nearly every field</b>, but the <b>size of the gap has shifted over time for each field</b> — and <b>it isn’t the same everywhere.</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>In this report, <b>we examine the gender pay gap across a range of occupations over the past decade</b>.</p>

  <!-- Occupation composition section -->
  <section id="occupation-section">
    <h2 class="section-header">Do women enter into lower-paying occupations?</h2>
    <div id="occupation-text">
      <p><b>Could the gender wage gap be due to women entering lower-paying fields?</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>To examine that, we looked at the <b>proportion of male and female workers in each occupation, sorted by median pay</b> — highlighting which fields lean heavily male, which lean heavily female, and which remain balanced.</p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <!-- Observable Runtime embed placeholder -->

    <div id="occupation-text-2">
      <p>It’s clear that some occupations are strongly gendered.<br>
         Fields like Healthcare Support and Healthcare Practitioners are predominantly held by women,<br>
         while Construction and Maintenance remain overwhelmingly male‑dominated.<br>
         Other categories, such as Legal and Business & Finance, hovered just above 50% female, challenging some of our assumptions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>This observation led us to consider:<br><br><b>Does the percentage of women in an occupation 
        relate to how large or small the gender pay gap is within that field?</b><br><br>
        <b>Are female‑dominated industries more equitable when it comes to compensation — or 
            does the gap persist regardless of gender representation?</b><br><br>
            <b>How has that gap changed in the past decade?</b></p>

        <p>The <b>dumbbell chart shows the pay gap in broad fields over time</b>,
            while the <b>line chart captures how that gap might differ across specific roles
            within the same occupation</b>.<br>
            For example, how does pay differ between judges and lawyers by gender, 
            and how do those numbers contribute to the overall gap in the legal field?<br><br>
            Our line chart breaks down each occupation into its subcategories — <b>you can take a closer
            look at how individual roles within a field shape the broader trends</b>.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
    <div id="conclusion-text">
        <p>Across these visuals, <b>we find little evidence of consistent progress in 
            narrowing the gender pay gap</b>.<br><br>
            While there are cases where men’s and women’s earnings appear to converge,
            this is often due to declines in men’s wages rather than meaningful gains for women.<br><br>
            Gaps persist across broad occupational fields, but to fully understand the extent of
            the disparity, we had to look within those fields—comparing people in the same exact roles.<br><br>
            Ultimately, <b>the data reveals that the gender pay gap endures across industries
                and career paths, continuing to follow women regardless of the choices they make</b>.<br><br><br></p>
